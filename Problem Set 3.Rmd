# Part A

## Question 1:

When we first sketched our graphs, Paulina took the approach of looking at what specifically impacts a person's opinion when considering to become a conservationist or not. Raymond looked at the entire system to explore which factors are making these decisions and impacting the socio-ecological system as a whole.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
require(png)
img <- readPNG('Paulina_diagram.png',native = T)
plot(NA,xlim=c(0,nrow(img)),ylim=c(0,ncol(img)),xaxt='n',yaxt='n',xlab='',ylab='')
rasterImage(img,0,0,nrow(img),ncol(img))
```

img <- readPNG('Raymond_diagram.png',native = T)
plot(NA,xlim=c(0,nrow(img)),ylim=c(0,ncol(img)),xaxt='n',yaxt='n',xlab='',ylab='')
rasterImage(img,0,0,nrow(img),ncol(img))
```

## Question 2:

When we came together to talk about what we did we both felt like Paulina did a great job added structure to the model which we used to build our final diagram. Raymond added all the extra bits and pieces that influence each mechanism indiviudally. After some painstaking drawing on an online software we were able to create the following diagram using both of our ideas.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
require(png)
img <- readPNG('Final_diagram.png',native = T)
plot(NA,xlim=c(0,nrow(img)),ylim=c(0,ncol(img)),xaxt='n',yaxt='n',xlab='',ylab='')
rasterImage(img,0,0,nrow(img),ncol(img))
```

## Question 3:

We were given the following equation:
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = kx(1-x)(-1+j(1-C)-{\sigma}P(1-x)+{\phi}(2x-1))$$
and asked to define the variables.

* k = The number of new conservationists added to the population per time step (in this case per year)
* x = the fraction of individuals in the population willing to participate in coral conservation
* C = live coral cover on the reef
* P = number of parrotfish
* j = the rate of coral degradation (caused by algae cover, disease, natural disasters, etc.)
* $\sigma$ = Fishing rate
* $\phi$ = The sensitivity to the norms of society. (How easily influenced an individual is by others.)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
require(png)
img <- readPNG('Parameters.png',native = T)
plot(NA,xlim=c(0,nrow(img)),ylim=c(0,ncol(img)),xaxt='n',yaxt='n',xlab='',ylab='')
rasterImage(img,0,0,nrow(img),ncol(img))
```

From finding out these variables and working through the differential equation we were able to create a new diagram depicting the elements involved in the equation. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
require(png)
img <- readPNG('Parameter_diagram.png',native = T)
plot(NA,xlim=c(0,nrow(img)),ylim=c(0,ncol(img)),xaxt='n',yaxt='n',xlab='',ylab='')
rasterImage(img,0,0,nrow(img),ncol(img))
```

## Question 5:

``` {r coral}

require(deSolve)

# Initial values
state <- c(X = 0.5) #proportion of total population that are conservationists
times <- seq(0, 100, by = 0.1)

# Parameters
parameters <- c(k = 1.014,j = 1.68, s = 0.5, phi = 0.2, C = 0.3, P = 0.5)

# Model
consv <- function(t,state,parameters){
  with(as.list(c(state,parameters)),{
       dX <- k*X*(1-X)*(-1+j*(1-C)-s*P*(1-X)+phi*(2*X-1))
      list(c(dX))   
  })}

# Solve model and plot results 
out <- ode(y = state,times=times,func=consv,parms=parameters) 
par(mfrow=c(1,1))

plot(out[,1],out[,2],ylab='X',xlab='time',las=1)

```

(a) What are the long-term dynamics of the system with the default parameters given below?

When half the population are already conservationists and live coral cover and Parrotfish abundance are both at 50%, the long-term dynamics of the system go to zero, meaning that when coral and Parrotfish are fairly healthy, fewer people will have an opinion on coral conservation. However, once live coral cover decreases to 30%, the proportion of people who become conservationists begins to increase.

(b) What are the most important parameters in determining long-term dynamics? 

The most important parameters in determining long-term dynamics in this system are live coral cover. As Parrotfish abundance decreases, the proportion of people willing to participate in coral conservation continues to decrease, therefore, it is not an important paramater.

## Question 8

As a group, we predict that macro-algae will continue to dominate the system. This will result in all other variables decaying. We anticipate that gamma, the competition between macroalge and turf, and 'a,' the competition between macro-algae and coral will be the most important parameters.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

require(deSolve)
coupled_model <- function(Time, State, Pars) {
  with(as.list(c(State, Pars)), {
    dM <-  a*M*C - (P*M)/(M+T) + gamma*M*T
    dC <-  r*T*C - d*C - a*M*C
    dT <- (P*M)/(M+T) - gamma*M*T - r*T*C + d*C
    dP <- s*P*(1 - P/C) - sigma*P*(1 - X)
    dX <- kappa*X*(1 - X)*(-1 + j*(1 - C) - sigma*P*(1 - X) + phi*(2*X - 1))
    return(list(c(dM,dC,dT,dP,dX)))  
  })
}

pars <- c(a = 0.1, gamma = 1, r = 1.0, d = 0.1, s = 0.49, sigma = 0.1, kappa= 1.014, j=1.68, sigma = 0.5, phi = 0.2) 


yini  <- c(M = 0.05, C = 0.9, T = 0.05, P = 0.4, X = 0.5)
times <- seq(0, 100, by = 0.1)
out   <- ode(yini, times, coupled_model, pars)

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
matplot(out[ , 1], out[ , 2:5], type = "l", xlab = "time", ylab = "Percent cover",main = "Ecological dynamics", lwd = 2,ylim=c(0,1))
legend('topright',legend = c('macroalgae','coral reef','turf algae','parrotfish'),col = c(1,2,3,4),pch = 18)

matplot(out[ , 1], out[ , 6], type = "l", xlab = "time", ylab = "Fraction that are conservationists",main = "Conservation opinion", lwd = 2,ylim=c(0,1),col=5)


```

Figure 7. Coral reef dynamics and conservation opinion. 

(a) The long-term dynamics of the system at the given parameters show that while the coral reef, turf algae, and Parrotfish decrease, macro-algae and conservation opinion will increase. 

(b) We have determined the most important parameters to be the death rate of coral, competition between macro-algae and turf, and the fishing rate. In this system, if we are able to decrease the death rate of coral and fishing, then live coral and Parrotfish populations should both persist at healthy levels while macro-algae and turf remain at lower levels. However, when the system is persisting at these levels, conservation opinion decreases and, therefore, we can also conclude that the sensitivity to coral abundance is an important parameter.

# Part C

## Question 11

As we predicted, the macro-algae continued to dominate the system while all other variables declined except for conservation opinion. 

## Question 12

At first, my flow diagram was quite simple compared to my partner's. Raymond was able to think of many more variables that would affect the system and expand the model. However, when we saw the actual model and made a diagram, we realized that it was very simple and that the variables were much more general and encompassed many of the details we had included in our conservation group diagram. Our coupled group diagram still included the generalized variables but became much more complex when we added the ecological system to our model. 

## Question 13

Some of the parameters are very general. Significant findings could potentially be lost when using a simplified model. For example, there are many social nuances that impact this system but most of those variables seem to have been lumped into a single parameter that would measure the sensitivity of an individual to the norms of society. If I were to refine this model I would work on expanding that parameter to encompass more of the social aspect of the system.

## Question 14

The collaboration aspect of this assignment was extremely beneficial to my learning. Having the chance to work with others gave me the opportunity to learn about how other students approached the assignment. In addition, I appreciated the format of the assignment. We started by working independently on a flow diagram, then came together with a partner or small team to work on a more complex analysis and then expanded in the last section to work with another group. This allowed me to develop my own thoughts and then gave me the collaborative support I needed to finish the assignment and gave me the opportunity to work with peers I had not previously worked with before.
